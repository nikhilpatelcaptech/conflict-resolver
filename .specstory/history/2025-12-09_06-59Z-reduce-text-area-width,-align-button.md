# Reduce text area width, align button (2025-12-09 06:59Z)

_**User (2025-12-09 07:45Z)**_

currently the layout is like this, I want to reduce width of text area and keep button on right side vertically.@src/ConflictResolver/ObjectConflictView.js:1-177

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to change the layout of the bottom section in ObjectConflictView.js. Currently:
- The textarea is full width
- The buttons are below the textarea in a row

They want:
- The textarea to have reduced width
- The buttons to be on the right side, arranged vertically

So I need to change the bottomSectionStyle to be a horizontal flex layout with:
- Left side: the label and textarea (reduced width)
- Right side: buttons stacked vertically

Let me modify the component to achieve this layout.</details></think>

---

I'll update the layout to have the textarea on the left with reduced width and the buttons stacked vertically on the right side.

Great, no linter errors. Let me read the file to verify the changes look correct.</details></think>

The layout has been updated. Here's what changed:

1. **Bottom section** now uses `flexDirection: "row"` to place the textarea and buttons side-by-side
2. **Textarea container** takes `flex: 1` to fill available width on the left
3. **Buttons** are now in a vertical column on the right side, aligned to the bottom with `justifyContent: "flex-end"`

The textarea will now be on the left with the buttons stacked vertically on the right side.

---

_**User (2025-12-09 07:45Z)**_

for @ScalarConflictView.js layout is like this.

_**Agent (model claude-4.5-opus-high-thinking, mode Agent)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user is showing that the ScalarConflictView.js still has the issue where the textarea is taking too much vertical space and the text area height seems too large for such a simple scalar value. Looking at the screenshot, the textarea is quite tall (seems to be using the full height of the bottom section).

Looking at the current code, the `customInputStyle` has `height: 60` which should be fine, but the `textareaContainerStyle` has `flex: 1` which might be causing it to expand. Also, the `bottomSectionStyle` has `height: 160` and `maxHeight: 160`.

Let me also check - the user mentioned they updated ScriptConflictView.js to change gap from 4 to 8. Maybe they want similar adjustments for ScalarConflictView.js?

Actually, looking at the screenshot more carefully:
1. The textarea seems quite tall
2. The layout looks correct (textarea on left, buttons on right)

Wait, looking again at the screenshot - it seems like the textarea is taking up a lot of space vertically. The issue might be that the `customInputStyle` has `height: 60` but the textarea is still expanding because `textareaContainerStyle` has `flex: 1`.

Let me also check if the textarea needs the `flex: 1` removed from its style since it already has a fixed height.

Actually, looking at the image again - it seems the layout IS working (textarea on left, buttons stacked vertically on right). But maybe the user wants some adjustment?

Let me re-read the user's message: "for @ScalarConflictView.js layout is like this."

They're just showing what it looks like now. Maybe they want me to see that it's working correctly? Or maybe they're pointing out something that needs to be fixed?

Looking at the image:
- There's "CUSTOM VALUE" label at the top
- A textarea with "xor" in it
- Buttons on the right side (Use Current, Use Incoming, Use Custom)


- "BLOCK CONTEXT (FROM WORKING OBJECT)" and "Path: blocksById.VrWjp41wgP.config.executionStrategy" at the bottom

I notice the block context details match the current implementation. The user might be confirming the layout or suggesting a minor tweak similar to the gap adjustment in ScriptConflictView.js. I'll consider applying the same gap change to maintain consistency across views.</details></think>

I see you updated `ScriptConflictView.js` to change the gap from 4 to 8. Let me apply the same change to `ScalarConflictView.js`:

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>
The user wants to disable all buttons once a conflict has been resolved. I need to check how the resolution status is tracked. Looking at the component, it receives `conflict` and `onResolve` as props. The conflict object likely has some property to indicate if it's resolved.

Let me check the ConflictResolver.js or useConflictResolver.js to understand how resolution is tracked.

Actually, looking at the current code, when `onResolve` is called, it probably updates the conflict's status. The conflict object might have a `resolution` or `resolved` property that gets set.

Let me check the useConflictResolver hook or the main ConflictResolver to understand the data structure.</details></think>

All done. The changes have been applied to all three conflict view components:- ScalarConflictView.js
- ObjectConflictView.js
- ScriptConflictView.jsNow when a conflict is resolved, all three buttons (Use Current, Use Incoming, Use Custom) will be disabled with reduced opacity and a "not-allowed" cursor.</details></think>

---

Done! All three conflict views now disable their buttons once resolved:

- **ScalarConflictView.js** ✓
- **ObjectConflictView.js** ✓
- **ScriptConflictView.js** ✓

When a conflict is resolved, buttons will:
- Be disabled (`disabled={resolved}`)
- Show 50% opacity
- Display a "not-allowed" cursor
